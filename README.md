# Investigating Techniques to Improve CNN Generalization on OOD Samples 

This repository is heavily inspired by the original work from the following repo:  
https://github.com/Spandan-Madan/generalization_to_OOD_category_viewpoint_combinations  
  
The original work is done by Madan et. al. We'll be using the original code provided by them as the baseline on which we'll make some modifications to investigate how we can improve on CNN generalization on OOD Samples.
